# Changelog

All notable changes to PyAPS are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR`, patch releases as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## Unreleased

### Known limitations
- A regular (non-editable) `pip install` does not bundle `configs/ExGal_configs`; set `PYAPS_CONFIGDIR`
  or use `pip install -e .` from a clone.

## [2.0] - 2026-09-29

First public release of PyAPS as a standalone, installable package.

### Added
- Public repository with installation instructions per use case (`pip install .` for the explorer,
  extras `[pipeline]`, `[cs]`, `[server]`, `[performance]`, `[dev]`, `[docs]`) and a table of exactly
  which packages each extra brings in.
- Environment variables for site-independent configuration: `PYAPS_HOME`, `PYAPS_PKG_DIR`,
  `PYAPS_CONFIGDIR`, `PYAPS_DATA_DIR`, `PYAPS_TEST_DATA`, `PYAPS_CS_MAIL`.
- `configs/script_params.yaml` written with `${PYAPS_HOME}` / `${PYAPS_PKG_DIR}` so it works unchanged
  from any checkout.
- Generic multi-user explorer `Dockerfile` with configurable UID/GID and thread count
  (`PYAPS_GUNICORN_THREADS`).
- Optional extension hook: separately installed add-on packages can contribute modules to the
  `PyAPS` namespace through the `pyaps.extensions` entry point. Nothing changes when none is installed.
- Test guard `tests/test_internal_imports.py` (every intra-package import resolves inside the tree)
  and a shared `tests/conftest.py` that skips data-dependent tests when no WEAVE data is available.
- Project files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue and pull-request
  templates, continuous integration, release workflow, dependency-update configuration.

### Changed
- Version stamped into all APS products (`aps_constants`) is now **2.0**.
- Minimum supported Python is **3.9**.
- Documentation and demo code use placeholders (`<PYAPS_DIR>`, `<PYAPS_DATA>`, `<FERRE_DIR>`, ...)
  instead of machine-specific absolute paths.
- The explorer's upstream-app handoff no longer has a built-in redirect URL; set
  `PYAPS_EXPLORER_WEAVEOR_URL` to enable it.
- The RR Lyrae contributed modules read the `CS_MAIL` header value from `PYAPS_CS_MAIL`
  instead of a hard-coded address.
- `TESTING.md` trimmed to the parts useful to any user.
- Dependency lists now reflect what the code imports; unused packages were removed from the extras.

### Removed
- Obsolete conda installation guide (`doc/PyAPS_conda_install.txt`); use the installation section of the README.
- Site-specific operational tooling, scratch/debug code and internal documents moved out of this
  repository (they were never part of the scientific pipeline).
- Tracked symlinks to local data volumes.

## [1.9] - 2026-08-24
Last version developed in the previous single repository.
